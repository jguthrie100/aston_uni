# Aston Uni projects

A couple of projects from my Aston uni days

- CAMCAS
  Camcas was a Java group project from 2nd year or so which modelled a Student/Tutor system, where a tutor could set multi-choice exams that the 
  students would complete. Complete with GUI. 


- trafficsim
  Trafficsim was my Final Year Project (written in Flash Actionscript) which modelled a traffic junction. It was designed to try and work out optimal 
  system to improve traffic flow over the junction. Individual cars all travel towards the junction and depending on the setting, are either subjected
  to traffic lights, 4-way-stop lines or a sort of hybrid 'auto stop' where cars would communicate and message each other ahead of time to work out 
  priority for who should enter the junction.
  
  Contained a full Flash GUI and options to change variables to vary the traffic flow and junction-automation settings.
